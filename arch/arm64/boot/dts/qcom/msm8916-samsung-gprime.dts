 * Unfortunately, the firmware is signed and cannot be replaced easily.
 * There seems to be no way to boot ARM64 kernels on 32-bit devices at the

 *
 * However, it is possible to use this device tree by compiling an ARM32 kernel
 * instead. For clarity and build testing this device tree is maintained next
